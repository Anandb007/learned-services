What is an Endpoint?
    An Endpoint (specifically an Interface Endpoint) is a network interface within your VPC that allows your resources to privately connect to AWS services or custom Endpoint Services using PrivateLink.
    It enables secure, private communication by routing traffic over the AWS network instead of the public internet.

üõ†Ô∏è Real-world use case example:
    Imagine your EC2 instances need to access AWS KMS or a partner‚Äôs service privately.
    You create an Interface Endpoint in your VPC that connects directly to the service, ensuring all traffic stays within the AWS network and does not go over the internet.

üéØ Core Components:
    Component                                        Description
    ENI (Elastic Network Interface)                  The actual network interface created inside your subnet to route traffic privately.
    Private DNS                                      DNS that resolves the service domain to the private IP of the Endpoint.
    Route	                                           Traffic from your subnet routes through the Endpoint‚Äôs ENI to reach the target service privately

gateway emdpoint is only for dynamo and s3 buckets
  S3 and DynamoDB are global services (they operate across all AZs and regions)
  They can be accessed using VPC route tables, so traffic from your subnet can be routed directly to these services over the AWS backbone

interface for remaing services 
  Interface endpoints for remaining services use Private DNS to override public DNS and are required for private access to most AWS service APIs

What is an Endpoint Service?
    An Endpoint Service is your own application or service running in AWS that you want others to access privately via PrivateLink.
    It lets you expose your service securely inside a VPC without exposing it to the internet.
    Other AWS accounts or VPCs create Interface Endpoints that connect privately to your Endpoint Service.

üõ†Ô∏è Real-world use case example:
    Imagine run a SaaS app with an API behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB) inside your VPC.
    want your customers to connect privately from their VPCs without traffic going over the internet.
    can create an Endpoint Service pointing to your NLB. Your customers create Interface Endpoints in their VPCs to connect to your service securely.

üéØ Core Components:
Component                           Description
NLB	Network                         Load Balancer forwarding traffic to your app
Endpoint                            Service	AWS object representing your service exposing NLB for PrivateLink
Interface Endpoint                  Created by client VPCs to connect to your Endpoint Service

| Topic              | Endpoint (Interface Endpoint)                                         | Endpoint Service                                                               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition         | A network interface in your VPC that connects privately to a service. | A service you create to expose your own application privately via PrivateLink. |
| Purpose            | Allows a VPC to privately access AWS or third-party services.         | Enables other VPCs/accounts to privately connect to your service.              |
| Who creates it?    | Created by the service consumer inside their VPC.                     | Created by the service provider who owns the service.                          |
| Function           | Acts as a client-side connection point for private access.            | Acts as the server-side endpoint that accepts private connections.             |
| Connection target  | Connects to an AWS service or a custom Endpoint Service.              | Points to a Network Load Balancer that fronts your service.                    |
| Traffic flow       | Initiates and sends requests privately over the AWS backbone.         | Receives requests and routes them to backend resources privately.              |
