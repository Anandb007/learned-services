What is Docker Networking?

Docker networking allows containers to:

Communicate with each other

Communicate with the host

Communicate across multiple hosts

Docker provides multiple network drivers to support different use cases.

🔹 Types of Docker Networks

Bridge

Host

None

Overlay

Macvlan (advanced)

1️⃣ Bridge Network
What is Bridge Network?

Default Docker network on a single host

Containers get private IP addresses

Uses a virtual bridge called docker0

NAT is used for outbound traffic

Architecture
Container A ──┐
              ├── docker0 bridge ── Host Network
Container B ──┘

Commands
docker network ls
docker network inspect bridge


Run container on bridge:

docker run -d --name web -p 80:80 nginx


User-defined bridge (recommended):

docker network create my-bridge
docker run -d --network my-bridge nginx

Real-Time Use Cases

Jenkins + MySQL on the same EC2

Microservices on a single VM

Local development

Container-to-container communication using names (DNS)

2️⃣ Host Network
What is Host Network?

Container shares host’s network stack

No network isolation

No port mapping required

Architecture
Container ↔ Host Network (same IP, same ports)

Command
docker run -d --network host nginx

Real-Time Use Cases

High-performance applications

Monitoring agents (node-exporter, datadog)

Legacy apps requiring host networking

Drawbacks

Port conflicts

Security risks

Linux-only (limited on Docker Desktop)

3️⃣ None Network
What is None Network?

Container has no external network access

Only loopback (lo) interface available

Command
docker run -d --network none busybox sleep 1000

Real-Time Use Cases

Batch jobs

File processing

Data encryption/decryption

Highly secure workloads

4️⃣ Overlay Network (Multi-host)
What is Overlay Network?

Enables container communication across multiple Docker hosts

Uses VXLAN tunneling

Requires Docker Swarm

Important Rule

Overlay networks do not work without Docker Swarm

Is Docker Swarm mandatory?

✅ YES

All nodes must:

Have Docker installed

Be part of the same Swarm cluster

Swarm Setup Example

Manager node

docker swarm init


Worker node

docker swarm join --token <token> <manager-ip>:2377

Create Overlay Network
docker network create -d overlay my-overlay

Service Creation Example
docker service create \
  --name backend \
  --network my-overlay \
  nginx

What happens internally?

Swarm schedules the service

Container starts on any node

Container gets overlay IP

Docker DNS maps service name to container(s)

Traffic is load-balanced automatically

Service Discovery
curl http://backend


No IPs required — DNS is built-in.

🔹 Same Subnet vs Different Subnet Communication
Same Subnet

Direct private IP communication

Overlay VXLAN encapsulation

Works out of the box

Different Subnets

Works if routing exists

Subnets must be reachable (same VPC / peered VPC / VPN)

Overlay abstracts the complexity

Traffic Flow
Container → VXLAN → Host IP → Network → Host IP → VXLAN → Container

🔒 Required Ports for Overlay Networks
Port	Protocol	Purpose
2377	TCP	Swarm management
7946	TCP/UDP	Node discovery
4789	UDP	Overlay VXLAN traffic
5️⃣ Macvlan Network (Advanced)
What is Macvlan?

Container gets its own IP from the physical network

Appears as a real machine on the LAN

Use Cases

Legacy applications

Direct LAN access

No port mapping required

⚠️ Requires careful configuration.

🧠 Bridge vs Overlay (Quick Comparison)
Feature	Bridge	Overlay
Scope	Single host	Multi-host
Swarm Required	❌ No	✅ Yes
DNS Discovery	Limited	Built-in
Production Use	Small setups	Large distributed systems
🎯 Interview One-Liners

Bridge → Default single-host networking

Host → Best performance, no isolation

None → Fully isolated container

Overlay → Multi-host virtual network using VXLAN

✅ Best Practices

Use user-defined bridge networks

Use overlay networks for production

Avoid default bridge in real projects

Never hardcode container IPs

Always allow required Swarm ports

📦 Real-World Examples

Jenkins + MySQL → Bridge network

Microservices on EC2 cluster → Overlay network

Monitoring agents → Host network

Batch processing jobs → None network

📌 Summary

Docker networking enables scalable, secure, and flexible container communication.
Choosing the right network driver is critical for performance, security, and maintainability.
